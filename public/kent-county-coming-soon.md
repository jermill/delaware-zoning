## Why the delay?

Unlike New Castle and Sussex Counties, Kent County's GIS data requires direct coordination with their planning department. We're committed to using only **official, verified data** to ensure accuracy for your important property decisions.

**We never use mock or estimated data for real estate decisions.**
