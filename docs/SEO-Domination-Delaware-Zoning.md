## 🔥 The "Unfair Advantage" Play

**What nobody else is doing in Delaware:**

1. **County-by-County Deep Dives** — Your competitors write generic "zoning guide." You write "New Castle County R-1 Zoning: Everything You Need to Know" with ACTUAL New Castle ordinances embedded.

2. **Executable Examples** — Other sites say "Setbacks are required." You show: "In Wilmington Zone C-2, front setback is exactly 25 feet because of [specific ordinance section]."

3. **Interactive Tool + Content** — Your blog posts link directly to the tool. "Read about allowed uses → instantly check if YOUR property qualifies."

4. **Real-Time Updates** — When Delaware changes zoning (rare but happens), you publish within 48 hours. You become the news source.

5. **Local Authority** — All your competitors are national. You're the LOCAL EXPERT. That's worth 10x more in ranking authority for geo searches.
